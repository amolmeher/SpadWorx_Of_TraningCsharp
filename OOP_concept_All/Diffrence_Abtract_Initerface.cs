/*
 An abstract class doesn't provide full abstraction but an interface does provide full abstraction; i.e. both a declaration and a definition is given in an abstract class but not so in an interface.
Using abstract we cannot achieve multiple inheritance but using an Interface we can achieve multiple inheritance.
We can not declare a member field in an Interface.
We can not use any access modifier i.e. public, private, protected, internal etc. because within an interface by default everything is public.
An Interface member cannot be defined using the keyword static, virtual, abstract or sealed.
